        <p> in 1911,the disneys moved to kansas city missouri there, Disney attended the benton 
        grammer school,where he met fellow student walter pfeiffer, who came from a family of 
         theatre fans and introduced him to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. before
        long.disney was spending more time at the pfeiffers' house than at home Elias had purchased
        a newspaper delivery route for The kansas city star and kansas city times.Disney and his
        brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the times before school and repeated
        the round for the evening star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often
         received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for
        more than six years. he attended saturday courses at the kansas city art institute and 
        also took a correspondence course in cartooning.</p>
